    <h1>Quick Start Guide</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Set a nameplate with a small icon, no scribbles in the background and high contrast.</li>
        <li>Add patterns like <code>* Golden Hotdog</code></li>
        <li>Partial wildcards don't work: <del class="code">L* S*ing Ham*</del></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Is this legal?</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The <a href="https://fallguys.com/eula-combined">Mediatonic EULA</a> say that a hack or a cheat is defined as a tool giving you a competitive advantage. Since your name is not making you faster, we should be good. I also do not think this tool is fraudulent. No memory modification, no log-file-analysis, no data-mining, just making a screenshot and pressing a button. Instead of giving players a bad experience (we all hate cheaters), this tool makes us all happy by people having cool names. This is also why I didn't hesitate to provide my email and steam account in the about section. I don't feel like I have to hide. If Mediatonic reads this, and is not sharing my opinion, feel free to get in touch with me.</p>
        <p>I used the tool extensively during testing and had no problems at all. But as always: Use at your own risk :)</p>

    <h1>Possible Name Occurences</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>I kindly refer you to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jSAlQGSY4-mX4mDfDxfQA4GISTS--FDibHp86GtDyiI/edit#gid=0">this list</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Patterns</h1>
    <h2>Adding, Editing, Removing</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Add Patterns by clicking on the <code>add</code> button. To edit them, you can also double click in the list aside the proper button. To remove, you can also press <code>DEL</code> or <code>BACKSPACE</code>.</p>
        <p>If you navigate to <code>%APPDATA%/FallGuysNameFinder/Patterns.txt</code>, you can also do a text-file-based editing (not recommended). Note that there is no file watcher. Restart the software after you edited this file.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Pattern Format</h2>
    <div class="content">

        <p>To add a specific name, just enter the proper words. Please watch your spelling!</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <ul class="code">
            <li>Cold Gaming Gamer</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Wildcards</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <img src="patterns.png" align="right" />
        <p>There is the option to add a <code>*</code> as a wildcard or placeholder. Whatever will be rolled on that position, it will match.</p>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul class="code">
            <li>* Gaming Gamer</li>
            <li>Good * Yeeter</li>
            <li>* * Hotdog</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The pattern <code>* * *</code> would match to everything.</p>
        <p><span class="warn">Attention: </span> You can not use the star to wildcard single parts of a name. The following example does not work.</p>
        <ul class="code">
            <li>Good Yeeted Yeet*</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have to record two patterns for this case:</p>
        <ul class="code">
            <li>Good Yeeted Yeeter</li>
            <li>Good Yeeted Yeetus</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="warn">Attention: </span> Patterns must match exactly. Watch your spelling!</p>
    </div>

            <figcaption>Matches on <code>Alawys Adoring Acrobat</code>, but not on Always Beaming Champion</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </div>

        <h1>Pools</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Yet there is no option to define pool-matching, like you define a bunch of acceptable first, second and third names, and any combination of these will match. This will come in v1.1 approx late September.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Setting up Fall Guys</h1>
        <h2>Nameplate</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The software takes screenshots of the ingame-footage. Thus, the result quality depends on your nameplate. Obey the following rules, whereas their importance goes from very high to high.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Nameplate must <b>not have scribbles or drawings</b> in its backgorund. It should be as unicolor as possible.</li>
                <li>The <b>left-side graphic</b> of the nameplate should be as far away from your name as possible. If it's too large, parts of it may get captured in the screenshot. This usually gets filtered, but may not be optimal.</li>
                <li>The nameplate should have a <b>high contrast</b>. The screenshot will anyway be transformed to monochrome, so its not massively important, but try to avoid yellow plates anyway.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><span class="warn">Important: </span>Observe the program's behaviour for a while before you leave it running afk, to ensure your settings work well.</p>
        </div>

                <img src="gootPlate1.png" />
                <figcaption>Recommended Plate<br />Unicolor background.<br />Only few flame tips interfere.<br />Sufficient contrast.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="gootPlate2.png" />
                <figcaption>Recommended Plate<br />Thin image.<br />High contrast.<br />Binary background usually no problem.</figcaption>

            </figure>
        </div>

        <h2>Nickname</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>On failures, the screenshot size gets varied to tickle the OCR engine. This means your nickname may also be captured. If your nickname is similar to a possible name, it may actually get matched instead of your actual name. Thus the rules are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose a simple nickname, one word only. Less words are better.</li>
                <li>Your nickname shall not be similar to an actual possible name.</li>
                <li>Recommended Nickname: <code>Parkour!</code> or <code>Tryhard</code> (Far away from any possible name and only one word)</li>
                <li>Bad Nickname: Rookie (Rookie is a possible name, the engine may get confused)</li>
                <li>Bad Nickname: Pro Slimb Climber (Three words, three potential confusion points)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This of course only applies if you're game is running in English.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="picarray">

                <img src="badNickname1.png" />
                <figcaption>Terrible Setup.<br />Contrast too low.<br />The third word will often fail.<br /> Nickname is a name possibility.<br />Will often result in "Rocky Singing Rookie"</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="gootNickname1.png" />
                <figcaption>Plate bad, nickname good.<br />Bright artifacts at right do interfere.<br />Snowflake may not be parsed everytime.<br />Since parkour is no name option, this will at least not result in "Special Bitter Parkour"</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>

        <h2>Resolution and Windowed Mode</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The higher the resolution, the better it will work. 1080p and larger is recommended. The engine is very robust and will also work on 720p, but it is not recommended.</p>
            <p>The tool has been tested for 16:9 aspect ratios with the exception of 1920x1200 also being supported (cause I have that :D ). It works in full screen, as well as windowed. If you only have one monitor, windowed mode could be interesting to observe the console.</p>
            <p><span class="warn">Warning: </span> The lower the resolution, the less accuracy! The effect is well noticable at resolutions lower than 1920x1080!</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Letting it run</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>After everything is setup, navigate to your profile page, so that the name can be rerolled. Press the start button and ensure that Fall Guys is in keyboard-focus (it must be the active window). You can move the console and the NameFinder to your secondary screens or just minimize them.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Console</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>If you like, you can show the console. This gives you information about what the software is doing. This helps a lot in the beginning to detect if it runs smoothly with your settings or if it is struggling. Just move it to your secondary monitor, if available. You can also run Fall Guys in windowed mode, if you only have one monitor.</p>
            <p><span class="warn">Attention:</span> Don't mark text on the console. This halts the program. If you are stuck, just click into the console and press a few times <code>ENTER</code></p>
            <p><span class="warn">Attention:</span> Don't close the console. Imagine the conosle is the program's mind and the UI is the body. As we know from Matrix, the body can't exist without a mind.</p>
        </div>

        <h1>Options</h1>

        <h2>Stop on Alliteration</h2>
        <img src="options.png" align="right" />

        <div class="content">
            <p>The software will stop rerolling your name, whenever all three words start with the same letter.</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul class="code">
                <li>Chic Chasing Crown</li>
                <li>Gifted Gaming Goliath</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Stop on double-word</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The software will stop rerolling your name, whenever two of three words start with the same 4 letters.</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <ul class="code">
                <li>Bouncy Yeeted Yeeter</li>
                <li>Nify Dancing Dancer</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="warn">Attention:</span> Beware that the double-words are not hardcoded. Note the following counter examples. Gaming and Gamer don't share the same first four letters. Infallible and fall neither. You would have to add these combinations manually. On the other hand, <code>Charging Charmer</code> would match since the first four letters are equal. It's a bit of a compromise-option.</p>
            <ul class="code">
                <li>Cold Gaming Gamer</li>
                <li>Infallible Fallen Apple</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Auto confirm name</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <img src="nameGenerationFailed.png" align="right" />

            <p>
                When you are rerolling your name, it is not instantly stored to your account. You could at any time <code>Alt+F4</code> the game, and you would keep the name you started with.
                This means, you can roll for a while, and if you are not happy with the results, just terminate the game process, and you can safely keep your old name.
                Let's say, you are called "Good Fall Guy", but you wan't to go for a "* Fall Guy". You are hoping for "Best Fall Guy" or "Great Fall Guy", but you get "Diggly Fall Guy" or sth, which you don't want.
                With this option unchecked, you can now just <code>Alt+F4</code> the game, and keep your "Good Fall Guy" you started with.
            </p>
            <p>
                So why should you enable it anyway then? Because if you idle for too long, you get disconnected from the server. Let's say you run the tool overnight. After 1hour, it finds just the perfect name.
                But until you wake up, you idle 8 hours in the profile page. Once you come back, you want to press <code>ESC</code> to return to the main menu and to definitely store your new name.
                But by that time, you are timed out and all you will see is an error. You would loose your newly rolled name! Thus, the engine will press <code>ESC</code> for you when you are still connected.
            </p>
            <p><span class="hint">Recommendation: </span>Have it checked until you read and understood what I just wrote.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Stop on error</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Sometimes, things may go wrong. Imagine you get your desired name, but the software doesn't recognize it. With this option, the program will halt, without it it will continue. Realistically, chances are super low that the error occurs on just that single perfect name. I spent a lot of effort to detect even unclear names on bad nameplates. The disadvantage of the option is, that if you want to run the program over night. It would be uncool if it stops after just a few minutes but you expected it to test thousands of names. Decide for yourself, if you want to be safe or if you want to take the risk of skipping your perfect name.</p>
            <p><span class="hint">Recommendation: </span>Test the software while you sit in front of your computer. Watch the console. Let it run for a while. Observe if it runs well. If it does, chances are high that it will do so for most if not all cases. Then, enable the option if you are actively on your computer and can react on errors, but disable it if you run it overnight.</p>
            <p>Note that after 10 consecutive major errors, the engine stops regardless of your setting. For example, when your profile page is not open or Fall Guys crashed or so.</p>
