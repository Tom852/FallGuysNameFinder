    <h1>Quick Start Guide</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Set a nameplate with a small icon, no scribbles in the background and high contrast.</li>
        <li>Add patterns like <code>* Golden Hotdog</code></li>
        <li>Partial wildcards don't work: <del class="code">L* S*ing Ham*</del></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Possible Name Occurences</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>I kindly refer you to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jSAlQGSY4-mX4mDfDxfQA4GISTS--FDibHp86GtDyiI/edit#gid=0">this list</a>. We figured that the following three third names are missing, though:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Artist</li>
            <li>Peanut</li>
            <li>Lionheart</li>
        </ul>

    </div>


    <h1>Patterns</h1>
    <h2>Adding, Editing, Removing</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Add Patterns by clicking on the <code>add</code> button. To edit them, you can also double click in the list aside the proper button. To remove, you can also press <code>DEL</code> or <code>BACKSPACE</code>.</p>
        <p>If you navigate to <code>%APPDATA%/FallGuysNameFinder/Patterns.txt</code>, you can also do a text-file-based editing (not recommended). Note that there is no file watcher. Restart the software after you edited this file.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Pattern Format</h2>
    <div class="content">

        <p>To add a specific name, just enter the proper words. Please watch your spelling!</p>
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <ul class="code">
            <li>Cold Gaming Gamer</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Wildcards</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <img src="patterns.png" align="right" />
        <p>There is the option to add a <code>*</code> as a wildcard or placeholder. Whatever will be rolled on that position, it will match.</p>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul class="code">
            <li>* Gaming Gamer</li>
            <li>Good * Yeeter</li>
            <li>* * Hotdog</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The pattern <code>* * *</code> would match to everything.</p>
        <p><span class="warn">Attention: </span> You can not use the star to wildcard single parts of a name. The following example does not work.</p>
        <ul class="code">
            <li>Good Yeeted Yeet*</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You have to record two patterns for this case:</p>
        <ul class="code">
            <li>Good Yeeted Yeeter</li>
            <li>Good Yeeted Yeetus</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="warn">Attention: </span> Patterns must match exactly. Watch your spelling!</p>
        <p><span class="hint">Note: </span> Yet there is no option to define flexible patterns, like you define a bunch of acceptable first, second and third names, and any combination of these will match. This will come later.</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Setting up Fall Guys</h1>
    <h2>Nameplate</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The software takes screenshots of the ingame-footage. Thus, the result quality depends on your nameplate. Obey the following rules, whereas their importance goes from very high to high.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Nameplate must <b>not have scribbles or drawings</b> in its backgorund. It should be as unicolor as possible.</li>
            <li>The <b>left-side graphic</b> of the nameplate should be as far away from your name as possible. If it's too large, parts of it may get captured in the screenshot. This usually gets filtered, but may not be optimal.</li>
            <li>The nameplate should have a <b>high contrast</b>. The screenshot will anyway be transformed to monochrome, so its not massively important, but try to avoid yellow plates anyway.</li>

        </ol>
        <p><span class="warn">Important: </span>Observe the program's behaviour for a while before you leave it running afk, to ensure your settings work well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="picarray">
        <figure>
            <img src="gootPlate1.png" />
            <figcaption>Recommended Plate<br />Unicolor background.<br />Only few flame tips interfere.<br />Sufficient contrast.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>Bad Plate:<br />Placeholder.</figcaption>
        </figure>
    </div>

    <h2>Nickname</h2>
    <div class="content">On failures, the screenshot size gets varied to tickle the OCR engine. This means your nickname may also be captured. If your nickname is similar to a possible name, it may actually get matched instead of your actual name. Thus the rules are:</div>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose a simple nickname, one word only. Less words are better.</li>
        <li>Your nickname shall not be similar to an actual possible name.</li>
        <li>Recommended Nickname: Parkour! (Far away from any possible name and only one word)</li>
        <li>Bad Nickname: Rookie (Rookie is a possible name, the engine may get confused)</li>
        <li>Bad Nickname: Pro Slimb Climber (Three words, three potential confusion points)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Resolution and Windowed Mode</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The higher the resolution, the better it will work. 1080p and larger is recommended. The engine is very robust and will also work on 720p, but it is not recommended.</p>
        <p>The tool has been tested for 16:9 aspect ratios with the exception of 1920x1200 also being supported (cause I have that :D ). It works in full screen, as well as windowed. If you only have one monitor, windowed mode could be interesting to observe the console.</p>
        <p><span class="warn">Warning: </span> The lower the resolution, the less accuracy! The effect is well noticable at resolutions lower than 1920x1080!</p>
    </div>



    <h1>Letting it run</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>After everything is setup, navigate to your profile page, so that the name can be rerolled. Press the start button and ensure that Fall Guys is in keyboard-focus (it must be the active window). You can move the console and the NameFinder to your secondary screens or just minimize them.</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Console</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>If you like, you can show the console. This gives you information about what the software is doing. This helps a lot in the beginning to detect if it runs smoothly with your settings or if it is struggling. Just move it to your secondary monitor, if available. You can also run Fall Guys in windowed mode, if you only have one monitor.</p>
        <p><span class="warn">Attention:</span> Don't mark text on the console. This halts the program. If you are stuck, just click into the console and press a few times <code>ENTER</code></p>
        <p><span class="warn">Attention:</span> Don't close the console. Imagine the conosle is the program's mind and the UI is the body. As we know from Matrix, the body can't exist without a mind.</p>
    </div>




    <h1>Options</h1>

    <h2>Stop on Alliteration</h2>
    <img src="options.png" align="right" />

    <div class="content">
        <p>The software will stop rerolling your name, whenever all three words start with the same letter.</p>
        <h4>Examples:</h4>
        <ul class="code">
            <li>Chic Chasing Crown</li>
            <li>Gifted Gaming Goliath</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Stop on double-word</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The software will stop rerolling your name, whenever two of three words start with the same 4 letters.</p>
        <h4>Examples:</h4>
        <ul class="code">
            <li>Bouncy Yeeted Yeeter</li>
            <li>Nify Dancing Dancer</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="warn">Attention:</span> Beware that the double-words are not hardcoded. Note the following counter examples. Gaming and Gamer don't share the same first four letters. Infallible and fall neither. You would have to add this combination manually (see below).</p>
        <ul class="code">
            <li>Cold Gaming Gamer</li>
            <li>Infallible Fallen Apple</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Stop on error</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Sometimes, things may go wrong. Imagine you get your desired name, but the software doesn't recognize it. With this option, the program will halt, without it it will continue. Realistically, chances are super low that the error occurs on just that single perfect name. I spent a lot of effort to detect even unclear names on bad nameplates. The disadvantage of the option is, that if you want to run the program over night. It would be uncool if it stops after just a few minutes but you expected it to test thousands of names. Decide for yourself, if you want to be safe or if you want to take the risk of skipping your perfect name.</p>
        <p><span class="hint">Recommendation: </span>Test the software while you sit in front of your computer. Watch the console. Let it run for a while. Observe if it runs well. If it does, chances are high that it will do so for most if not all cases. Then, enable the option if you are actively on your computer and can react on errors, but disable it if you run it overnight.</p>
        <p>Note that after 10 consecutive major errors, the engine stops regardless of your setting. For example, when your profile page is not open or Fall Guys crashed or so.</p>
